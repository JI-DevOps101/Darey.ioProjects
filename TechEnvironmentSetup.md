### Tech Environment Setup
This project has to do with outlining and explaining the tech setup needed on your computer, which is required for properly learning desired skills to become a practising Devops Engineer/practional. It covers a list of the essential tools that have been installed and configured on my PC shown below:

**Essential Tools installed are:**

  - Visual Studio Code (VS code)
  - Git
  - Virtual box
  - Ubuntu on Virtual box
  - Github account
  - Amazon Web Services account
  
It further details a step by step breakdown of how each tool was installed on my PC using screenshots taken at each step. Then showing a simple test carried out to validate the successful installation of the tool, also highlighting any specific configuration done to achieve the effective setup. Thus, confirming the tool is is functioning properly as it is meant to and providing screenshot evidence to this regard. Let's take a look at each item on the list explaining what they are, what they are used for (functions) and relevance (reasons why they are needed).
